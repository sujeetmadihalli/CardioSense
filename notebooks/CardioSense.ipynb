        "**Goal:** This project explores the relationship between daily physical activity and cardiovascular health, specifically Resting Heart Rate (RHR).\n",
        "**Method:** Using personal Apple Watch data and public Fitbit data, I analyzed the impact of Steps, Active Calories, and Sleep on RHR using Linear Regression and Random Forest models.\n",
        "**Key Findings:**\n",
        "1.  **Long-Term vs. Short-Term:** Consistent activity over months lowers RHR, but high-intensity days can temporarily raise RHR due to recovery demands.\n",
        "2.  **The Role of Sleep:** For the general population (Fitbit), sleep duration was the strongest predictor of improved heart health.\n",
        "3.  **Model Performance:** While daily physiological noise limits prediction accuracy ($R^2 \\approx 0.25$), the models successfully identified the key drivers of heart health."

The purpose of the model is to determine weather increased physical activity leads to improvement in cardiovascular health, as reflected in resting heart rate. This model can help identify weather higher intensity or frequency of workouts is correlated with lower resting heart rate over time, which is often considered an indicator of improved fitness and heart health.\n",

By combining my own wearable health data with a larger, publicly avaible dataset of fitbit users, I can explore both my individual patterns and comapre them to a broader population. This makes the project authentic, personally meainingful and at the same time generalizable to a larger group.

It tells us what percentage of the variation in my daily heart rate is explained purely by my activity and sleep data. For health data, which is very noisy, an $R^2$ even around 0.20-0.30 is meaningful. It allows us to see if the model is finding any signal amidst the noise.\n",

A hard workout imposes acute physiological stress, which keeps the heart rate elevated while the body repairs itself. I learned that \"health improvement\" is a long-term adaptation, not an immediate daily reward."

Personalised Modeling for Fitbit:** Instead of aggregating 35 different users into one \"blob\" of data (Which led to a low $R^2$ of ~0.17), I would build individual regression models for each user ID or use a Mixed-Effects Model. This would account for the fact that every person has a differnt baseline heart rate."
